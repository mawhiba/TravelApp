Project Introduction:

This project is to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs

Following are the project prerequisites:

- Webserver - Node
- Web application framework for routing - Express
- Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and - - - prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
- External script - Service Worker
- External API - GeoNames, Weatherbit, Pixabay

For extending the project I pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results
