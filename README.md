Project Introduction:

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an 
application to understand the human language, written or oral.

Following are the project prerequisites:

- Webserver - Node
- Web application framework for routing - Express
- Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and - - - prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
